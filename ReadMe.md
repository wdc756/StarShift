# Star Shift

A lightweight python class validation library that mimics pydantic's BaseModel dict casting validation.

## This project is in Early Access, and core features are still being added

To be added:
- shift_config.allow_arbitrary_keys: throws error if key is found that doesn't match any value
- multiple fields for shift_validators and shift_setters
- better logging
- actual documentation
- proper type hints for shift_validators and shift_setters
